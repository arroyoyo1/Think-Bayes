    "-  $P(D)$ is, under any hypothesis, the **total probability of the data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  $P(H|D)$ is the probability of the hypothesis after we see the data, called the **posterior**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Computing the total probability of the data can be tricky. It is supposed to be the probability of seeing the data under any hypothesis at all, but it can be hard to nail down what that means. Most often we simplify things by specifying a MECE set of hypotheses and compute $P(D)$ using the Law of Total Probability."
